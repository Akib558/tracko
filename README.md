    A habit tracking app

In my application, I offer a comprehensive feature set designed to enhance the user experience. Users can seamlessly authenticate and register, manage habits with flexibility, and personalize their organization using labels and folders. Intuitive sorting and a dedicated focus mode optimize productivity, while a habit activity heatmap promotes self-awareness. The interface is sleek and user-friendly, and I employ <b>state management with Provider</b>, leverage <b>Firebase for authentication and cloud storage</b>, and utilize <b>Hive for efficient local storage</b>.
